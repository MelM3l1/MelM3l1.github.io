    <p>THE MEAN CATS (¬`‸´¬).</p>
    <p>Mr. Kitty and his friends were having a wonderful time playing outside on a sunny afternoon. They were laughing and chasing each other around while enjoying their favorite ball,
        tossing it back and forth with joy. Just as they were about to start a fun game of keep-away, a group of mischievous stray cats appeared from behind the bushes.
        With playful smirks on their faces, they dashed in and snatched the ball right from under their paws! (╥﹏╥)</p>
